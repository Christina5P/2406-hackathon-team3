Our purpose is to give you some information about stress to reflect to.
A ability to check your own stresslevel with our stress assesment and from that get som advice to start react on.

# Contents

## Features

We start with 2 information card to give you basic information of what stress is and how you can suffer from it.

After that there is focus to reflect of  yourself with an stress assessment how stressed you are in 4 different categories.
That give you a chance to be aware of where you dont have a good level and how to work on that, since it important to have a good balance in your life.

## Design
We want to have a calm and smooth design that get you to slow down and you don´t get too much context to stress over.
The icons visulize the tema.
The assessment is "clean with a slider to use, instead of thinking of 5-number grades.
Further down we have som general tips to start with and if you do the assessment, you get mote personalised tips for the category you need.
