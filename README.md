Welcome to the StressGuide App from Team StressLess

Live link: https://andersganander.github.io/2406-hackathon-team3/

StressGuide is an app designed to help individuals manage the common human problem of stress. <br>
Our goal is to provide you with valuable information about stress, allow you to assess your own stress levels,<br>
and offer advice on how to manage stress effectively. Additionally, we provide links to further resources to help you improve your well-being.

We aim to create a site that is understandable and easy to navigate.

# Contents

## Features

We start with two information cards that provide basic information on what stress is and how it can affect you.<br>

Next, we offer a stress assessment tool to help you reflect on your stress levels across four different categories. <br>
This tool helps you identify areas where you might need to improve your stress management,<br>
emphasizing the importance of maintaining a good balance in your life.

## Design
Our design is calm and smooth to help you slow down and avoid information overload.
The icons visualize the theme, and the assessment uses a clean slider instead of numerical grades.
Further down, we provide general tips, and personalized advice based on your assessment results.
